### Hi there 👋

I'm [Munaf Assaf](http://www.linkedin.com/in/munafassaf), a UX Design Manager at [Google Hardware](http://store.google.com). I mainly use this account to host old web and mobile projects, as well as private experiments. At the moment, I'm tinkering with SwiftUI and Machine Learning.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Stable Diffusion and PyTorch.
- 📫 Feel free to say hi on [Mastodon](http://mastodon.social/@munaf), [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/munafassaf) or [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/munafassaf).
